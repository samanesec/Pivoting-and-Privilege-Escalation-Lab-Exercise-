# Pivoting-and-Privilege-Escalation-Lab-Exercise-
üßë‚Äçüíª In this exercise, a vulnerable Windows machine is identified using an Nmap scan that confirms exposure to the EternalBlue vulnerability. The vulnerability is then exploited via Metasploit, establishing a Meterpreter reverse shell.

The exercise further demonstrates the use of Windows' built-in netsh tool to capture network traffic, enabling the extraction of login credentials transmitted unencrypted over HTTP. The traffic is saved as an ETL file, converted to PCAP format, and analyzed in Wireshark. Through this process, the exercise illustrates how weaknesses in both system configuration and application security can be combined to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

This project is a test exercise, not a real engagement. All sensitive information, including IP addresses and company names, has been anonymized for privacy. The user credentials used in the demonstration were taken from a previous lab assignment and are included solely as an example..
